Made with Visual Studio on 1/9/2026, UI inspired by https://github.com/harborsiem/YouTubeDownloader 

The "C-" in the repo name is just Git being dumb. This was not made in C and was instead made in C#.

Also, this project installs yt-dlp and ffmpeg if you give it admin perms but I haven't tested this. So if the project doesn't work, enable debug mode by going inside Visual Studio, enabling Debug Mode within Program.cs, and reading the errors. And if you don't have ffmpeg or yt-dlp, go install them here: 

ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows

yt-dlp: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

Thanks for using my tool!
